Safety Alert 

        From the International Association of Drilling Contractors 

 
ALERT 05 – 06 
 

SAFETY HOOK FAILURE - CHEMICAL CORROSION 

 
WHAT HAPPENED: 
 
While cleaning and inspecting the tethered toolbox, a Floorman noticed corrosion on one of the safety hooks 
attached  to  the  lanyard.    After  further  investigation  it  was  found  that  several  safety  hooks  had  swollen  to 
twice the normal size and deteriorated enough to break by hand. 

 
WHAT CAUSED IT: 
 
The  safety  hooks  were sent  to  a  lab  for  testing.  The  results  showed  the  corrosion  was  caused  by  calcium 
chloride. The calcium chloride was used by the rig for a completion job several hitches prior to noticing the 
damage. 

 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  To address this incident, this company did the following: 
 
Action Item 
 

1. 

Instructed rig personnel to Inspect all tethered tools immediately and remove from service any tools that 
may be damaged. 

 
Recommendations 
 

1. 

In  the  event  any  tools  have  to  be  replaced  now  or  in  the  future  ensure  they  are  equipped  with 
stainless steel safety hooks. 

2.  Keep  aluminum  tools  and  hooks  away  from  calcium  chloride.    If  safety  hooks  or  tools  contact  the 

chemical, wash with a mild detergent immediately and rinse thoroughly. 
Inspect tethered tools, safety lanyards, and safety hooks at regular intervals.
